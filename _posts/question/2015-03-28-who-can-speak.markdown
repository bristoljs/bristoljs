Anybody, and you don't even need to be an expert as long as you have something to share that is valuable to our group.
We like to keep out main talks very much on the JavaScript topic but also hold short lightning talks (up to 5min)
that can be on anything that our community is interested in. Check out some of the videos above to get an idea of the
style of talks.
