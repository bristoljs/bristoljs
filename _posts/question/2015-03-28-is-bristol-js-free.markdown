Yes! One of our main objectives is to be accessible to everyone. Thanks to our wonderful sponsors we're
able to hold our monthly meetups at no cost to the attendees and will often get some beverages and food
in for the evening as well.

Once in a while we *may* hold a paid workshop but will only do so if we can't find sponsorship.
